Project Description:
    This project continues off of Project 4. We are to have an actual game at this point. 


The easiest part of this project:
    The easiest part for me was the hud. Dr. Malloy gave more than enough examples
and they really helped me understand what I was supposed to do. 

Problems I had:
	The biggest problem I had was recording the darn thing. My previous linux distro
did not play well recording with my integrated GPU. I am now on Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo
(which is great for 4k displays) and had no issues at all. Stability is a beautiful thing!

	Outside of os issues, I ran into an issue with a segfault in a destructor. 
I spent hours trying to find it, but ended up reverting to an older version (thank you GitHub)
and being extra careful when adding the HUD (this version did not have the HUD implemented). 

	Shooting was another area that took a while. My Project 4 was doing compisition. I changed
project 5 to inherit from the Drawable class. This made it much easier to follow along with Dr. 
Malloy's YouTube videos and overall was an easier experience.
