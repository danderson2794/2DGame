This was my final project for Data Driven 2D Game Engine Construction. I took this course under Dr. Brian Malloy (retired) at Clemson University. 

In a bash terminal, run the following commands to install the libraries (Ubuntu / Debian):

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
