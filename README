Project no: #4

Project due date:

Project Description:
    Project 4 takes Project 3 and builds upon. The new project now has a 
controllable player that can interact with enemy spaceships. There is also
a HUD that demonstrates how to play and tells FPS. 

The easiest part of this project:
    Implementing the player was the easiest for me. 

Problems I had:
    I had a significant amount of trouble with the AI. I spent a lot of time
trying to get it to fly in the other direction. I thought Dr. Malloy's code 
would work well with my code, but I couldn't get it to change position smoothly.

Vision for the final project:
    In the next iteration, my sprite will fire a blaster that will zap the 
enemies instead of just colliding with them. I created all of the sprites in
my game. I will keep score on my game by keeping track of the size of the 
array and subtracting one every time the player kills an alien spaceship. 
The objective of the game will be to kill all the alien spaceships before 
they attack you. The game will conclude when either you kill all the aliens,
or the aliens kill you.
